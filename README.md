# Quora Desktop

This is my personal project. I'm practising HTML and CSS by recreate Quora's navigation bar. I use Quora's original for the icons by taking its SVG paths from the website after I'm not satisfied when using Materialize Icons and Ionic Icons. All criticism and suggestions are welcome.
